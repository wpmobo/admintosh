* **Limit Login Attempts**: After a preset number of attempts has been exceeded, this feature automatically stops any more attempts from a specific Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or username. This considerably reduces the potency of brute force attacks on your website.

* **Hide Login**: To change your login URL to whatever you want. This feature allows you to easily and securely change the URL of the login form page to anything you desire.

The wp-admin directory and wp-login.php page become inaccessible so your website becomes more secure.

* **Login History**: Monitor your website's users with detailed login information, including Last login date and time, Environment/server IP address Country, city, continent, timezone Latitude and longitude Browser details And much more.
